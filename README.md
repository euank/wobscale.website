## Bootstrap

This includes `bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2`, compiled with `$enable-flexbox =
true`, and otherwise default configuration. Hopefully someone remembers to
migrate us forwards to a supported release. That does mean we're opting out of
support for old IE versions, but looking back it's obvious that IE6 was *NOT*
wobscale so I think we're okay with that.

## Building

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required (and wobscale, so that's okay!). `npm start` should work for any recent version of that ecosystem.

## Contributing

Go for it. At the time of writing, this stuff wasn't written by a real webdev,
so whatever you do is probably an improvement.

## License

Apache 2.0; the vendored bootstrap folder is MIT (see the LICENSE file therin).
